# text-roleplay

ReactJS + TypeScript + Firebase

2 modes: basic and full

Goal of full mode was to play text role play games like Fallout PnP (in our case) or DnD fully in app. It has character sheet, inventory, items, chat for communication and all other neccessary features.

Basic mode has inventory, items and chat disabled. This mode acts mostly like Character Sheet. We played in Tabletop Simulator, but used this app for storing info about our characters.

List of features can be found here (only on Russian): https://github.com/StCost/text-roleplay/blob/master/src/components/Help.tsx
